let us assume i have a fleet of 7 trucks and i have 3 charger available.
given the list of 7 trucks with there battery capacity and current battery level
trucks=[T1(100KWH , 40%) , T2(120KWH,30%) , T3(110KWH ,50%) ,T4(130KWH ,30%) ,T5(150KWH ,10%) ,T6(80KWH ,20%) ,T7(120KWH ,20%)]
CHARGERS=[C1(20KW),C2(30KW),C3(42KW)]
FIRSTLY I WILL CREATE AN ARRAY WHICH INCLUDES THE CAPACITY TO CHARGE OF EACH TRUCK
FORMULA USED=TOTAL CAPACITY *(100-CURRENT LEVEL CHARGING)/100;
EXAMPLE FOR T1 : CAPACITY TO CHARGE=100*(0.6)=60KWH
CAPACITY TO CHARGE=[T1(60KWH), T2(84KWH), T3(55KWH), T4(90KWH), T5(135KWH) ,T6(64KWH), T7(96KWH)];

TOTAL TIME ASSUMING =5 HOURS

1ST APPROACH-
i)sort the capacity to charge array in ascending order
ii)pick the first n elements= no of chargers available
iii)map the charger with truck in following sequence- small charger = small battery and large charger=large battery
therefore - array after sorting will be [T3(55),T1(60),T6(64),T2(84),T4(90),T7(96),T5(135)];
NOW C1->T3  CHARGING TIME= CAPACITY TO CHARGE/CHARGING SPEED (2.75HR)
    C2->T1 (2HR)
    C3->T6 (1.5HR)

    AFTER 1.5HR C3 WILL BE VACANT SO PICKING NEXT 3 ELEMENTS
    C3->T7 (2.2HR) AFTER THIS C3 WILL COMPLETE ITS 3.7 HOUR
    AFTER 2HR FROM STARTING TIME C2 WILL BE FREE
    SO C2->T4 (3HR) NOW AFTER THIS C2 WILL COMPLETE ITS 5 HOUR
    ALSO THERE IS NO TRUCK THAT C1 CAN CHARGE AFTER CHARGING T3
    SO TOTAL TRUCKS CHARGED= T3,T1,T6,T7,T4 (TOTAL 5 TRUCK)


 2ND APPROACH
 i)sort the capacity to charge array in ascending order
 ii)pick the first n elements= no of chargers available
 iii)map the charger with truck in following sequence - small battery=large charger and large battery =small charger
  therefore - array after sorting will be [T3(55),T1(60),T6(64),T2(84),T4(90),T7(96),T5(135)];
  NOW C1->T6 (3.2HR)
      C2->T1 (2HR)
      C3->T3 (1.3HR)
      AFTER 1.3HR C3 WILL BE FREE SO PICKING NEXT THREE ELEMENTS
      C3->T2 (2HR)
      AFTER THIS C3 WILL COMPLETE ITS 3.3HR AND CANT CHARGE ANY OTHER TRUCK

     AFTER 2 HR C2 WILL BE FREE
     C2->T4 (3HR) NOW AFTER THIS C2 WILL COMPLETE ITS 5HR AND CANT CHARGE ANY OTHER TRUCK

     C1 ALSO CANT CHARGE ANY OTHER TRUCK

     SO TOTAL TRUCK CHARGE=T6,T1,T3,T2,T4 (TOTAL 5 TRUCKS)

 3RD APPROACH (FEASIBLE ONE)
 i)calculate the total kwh of each charger -
 c1=20*5=100kwh
 c2=30*5=150kwh
 c3=42*5=210kwh
 now we have array= [T3(55),T1(60),T6(64),T2(84),T4(90),T7(96),T5(135)];
 our approach - pick max element from array and subtract it from c1(kwh) and if it comes >=0 then okay otherwise pick second largest element
 now after assigning truck to c1 pick element just smaller then assigned to c1 and subtract it kwh from c2 and now find value<=kwh remaining in array
 now assign all smaller kwh to c3 until value become>=0

 ex- c1->t7
     c2->t4 , t1
     c3->t3, t6 , t2
     total trucks charged = 6 (max)
